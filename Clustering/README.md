# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering
This exercise explores the aspects of clustering and how to utilize different clustering methods. The data used in this exercise is presented as an Excel workbook containing two worksheets with each containing a different dataset. 
One dataset contains information on marketing newsletters/e-mail campaigns (e-mail offers sent to customers) and transaction level data from customers while the transactional dataset shows which offer customers responded to and what the customer ended up buying.

# Using Sentiment Analysis to See How the Negativity of Twitter Tweets in U.S. Concerning COVID-19 Changes During the Course of April 2020
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that primarily affects the lungs. It was first identified in Wuhan, China on December 2019 and has since spread worldwide, causing long-term lockdowns in many parts of the world. Besides taking a toll on medical health, it is indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic is also taking a toll on mental and social health, especially due to the stay-at-home orders. Thus, this capstone project aims to use sentiment analysis on COVID-19 Tweets in the U.S. to see how negativity towards the pandemic changes during the course of April 2020. The sentiment in this project will be categorized as positive, neutral, and negative.

The datasets that will be used for this project were created by Shane Smith (https://www.kaggle.com/smid80) and posted on Kaggle.com under the CC0: Public Domain. They are available for download via the following links:

This project could give mental healthcare workers and sociologists insights on how the COVID-19 pandemic situation is affecting the mental health of the U.S. populace who are heavily limited in their movements and social interactions to prevent the spread of the virus. Also, the results of this project could indicate how resources of psychological care could be distributed and utilized to mitigate any negative effects long-term pandemics and lockdowns may have on emotional health.

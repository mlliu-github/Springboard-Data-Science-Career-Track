# Frequentist Statistics

Frequentist Inference 1A - This exercise introduces concepts like t- and z-tests as well as how to calculate standard deviation from a sample and the Central Limit Theorem and gives some hands-on practice working with these concepts using simulated normal data.

Frequentist Inference 1B - This exercise gives additional practice using frequentist inference with real-world data from a hospital.
